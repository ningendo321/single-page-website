# single-page-website

This is simple website which I built from scratch.

Used skills: HTML, CSS, JS.

During coding, the only part that was complicated for me, was to make it responsive, because position of one image was absolute and it took me some time to find out what was going on. Other than that, I completed website without any problem.
